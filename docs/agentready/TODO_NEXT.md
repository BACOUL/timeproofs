## Main remaining roadmap

Read this file first:

```txt
docs/agentready/REMAINING_WORK.md
```

## Immediate next PR

```txt
docs(agentready): prepare Browser V1 release notes draft
```

## Build next

Requirements:

```txt
1. Draft Browser V1 release notes.
2. Include scope, supported inputs, outputs, limitations, non-goals, and next phase.
3. Keep release notes as draft until QA result is PASS.
4. Keep CLI after browser product stability.
5. Do not add backend, accounts, payments or dashboard.
6. Do not add runtime firewall.
7. Keep mandatory limitation text.
```

## Then

```txt
1. Run manual Browser V1 QA and fill BROWSER_V1_QA_RESULT.md
2. feat(agentready): add CLI only after browser product is stable
3. docs/seo: add public acquisition pages
4. docs(agentready): define AgentReady Checked trust layer
5. docs(product): prepare monetization path
6. chore(deploy): prepare Vercel reconnect after 2026-07-09
```

## Do not build yet

```txt
accounts
payments
dashboard
database
runtime firewall
old proof-of-existence product
```

## Mandatory limitation text

```txt
TimeProofs AgentReady does not guarantee that an AI agent will never fail.
It identifies structural risks that may cause AI agents to misuse APIs, tools or MCP servers.
```
