## Main remaining roadmap

Read this file first:

```txt
docs/agentready/REMAINING_WORK.md
```

## Immediate next PR

```txt
docs(agentready): start agent simulation exploration
```

## Build next

Requirements:

```txt
1. Define what “agent simulation” means for V1 exploration.
2. Define what must remain out of scope.
3. List static simulation signals that can be computed without executing tools.
4. Propose one OpenAPI simulation fixture.
5. Propose one MCP simulation fixture.
6. Define failure modes to simulate: wrong tool, unsafe parameter, missing confirmation, unrecoverable error.
7. Define how simulation results could appear in the report later.
8. Decide whether simulation is docs-only or code-backed for the next PR.
9. Keep the browser product stable before CLI.
10. Keep mandatory limitation text.
```

## Then

```txt
1. feat(agentready): add CLI only after browser product is stable
2. docs/seo: add public acquisition pages
3. docs(agentready): define AgentReady Checked trust layer
4. docs(product): prepare monetization path
5. chore(deploy): prepare Vercel reconnect after 2026-07-09
```

## Do not build yet

```txt
accounts
payments
dashboard
database
runtime firewall
old proof-of-existence product
```

## Mandatory limitation text

```txt
TimeProofs AgentReady does not guarantee that an AI agent will never fail.
It identifies structural risks that may cause AI agents to misuse APIs, tools or MCP servers.
```
