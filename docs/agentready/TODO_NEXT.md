## Main remaining roadmap

Read this file first:

```txt
docs/agentready/REMAINING_WORK.md
```

## Immediate next PR

```txt
docs(agentready): define browser V1 release gate
```

## Build next

Requirements:

```txt
1. Define what must be true before calling browser V1 complete.
2. Define which pages must be manually checked.
3. Define required exports.
4. Define blocking vs non-blocking issues.
5. Define release notes contents.
6. Define what remains after browser V1.
7. Keep CLI after browser product stability.
8. Do not add backend, accounts, payments or dashboard.
9. Do not add runtime firewall.
10. Keep mandatory limitation text.
```

## Then

```txt
1. feat(agentready): add CLI only after browser product is stable
2. docs/seo: add public acquisition pages
3. docs(agentready): define AgentReady Checked trust layer
4. docs(product): prepare monetization path
5. chore(deploy): prepare Vercel reconnect after 2026-07-09
```

## Do not build yet

```txt
accounts
payments
dashboard
database
runtime firewall
old proof-of-existence product
```

## Mandatory limitation text

```txt
TimeProofs AgentReady does not guarantee that an AI agent will never fail.
It identifies structural risks that may cause AI agents to misuse APIs, tools or MCP servers.
```
