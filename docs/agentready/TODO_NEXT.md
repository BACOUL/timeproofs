## Main remaining roadmap

Read this file first:

```txt
docs/agentready/REMAINING_WORK.md
```

## Immediate next PR

```txt
docs(agentready): decide static simulation parser scope
```

## Build next

Requirements:

```txt
1. Decide whether the next simulation step is docs-only or code-backed.
2. If code-backed, keep it static and browser-only.
3. Define the parser inputs and outputs.
4. Define whether simulation appears in agentready.json V1.1 or stays separate.
5. Define acceptance tests before writing code.
6. Keep CLI after browser stability.
7. Do not call APIs.
8. Do not call MCP tools.
9. Do not call LLMs.
10. Keep mandatory limitation text.
```

## Then

```txt
1. feat(agentready): add CLI only after browser product is stable
2. docs/seo: add public acquisition pages
3. docs(agentready): define AgentReady Checked trust layer
4. docs(product): prepare monetization path
5. chore(deploy): prepare Vercel reconnect after 2026-07-09
```

## Do not build yet

```txt
accounts
payments
dashboard
database
runtime firewall
old proof-of-existence product
```

## Mandatory limitation text

```txt
TimeProofs AgentReady does not guarantee that an AI agent will never fail.
It identifies structural risks that may cause AI agents to misuse APIs, tools or MCP servers.
```
