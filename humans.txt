/* ETHICS */
We build privacy-first, stateless, and open verification.
No personal data is ever stored. Proofs contain only hashes.
No blockchain, no tracking, no cookies.
Integrity, simplicity, and transparency guide every release.

/* TECHNOLOGY */
Stack: Cloudflare Workers (API), KV (Storage), Vercel (Frontend)
Language: JavaScript / HTML5 / Edge-native runtime
Hash: SHA-256 / HMAC-SHA256
Timestamp source: UTC / NTP multi-source

/* STANDARD */
Goal: Create a universal open standard for digital proof of existence.
